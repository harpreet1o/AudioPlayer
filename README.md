Reason- I always love to listen to music as music is one of the most important things in my life so created this app. Also I wanted to work with how the files work in a react app. I had learned about the firebase so wanted to try it aswell.

Working-
This is a music playing app starts with the login page where authentication is done by google authenticaion. [signup page](signinpage.png)Once its done the user is entered into the app. Here he can filter out the songs and listen to his favorite songs. [mainPage](mainPage.png)The songs are added to the library to the dashboard [adding new songs](addsongs.png). There you could create new artists and new albums and add new songs. For playing of songs external library is used audioplayer5 is used.

Tech stacks

3. Used the node js express js for the links api
4. Mongodb is used for the storing of the data
